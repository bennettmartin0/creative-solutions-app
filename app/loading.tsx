 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton UI or placeholder content.  This is useful for loading states in your app, such as when fetching data or rendering components that take time to load. You can customize the loading state to fit your app's design and user experience. For example, you might want to show a spinner, a skeleton screen, or a message indicating that content is being loaded. The Loading component will be displayed while the main content is being prepared, providing feedback to the user that something is happening in the background.

export default function Loading() {
    return <p>Loading content...</p>;
}
